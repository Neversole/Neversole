### Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am Natalie and I am passionate about Data Analytics. I will be graduating from Washington State University with a Bachelor of Science in Data analytics in the fall of 2023. I have completed all of my data analytics major requirements so I am ready to begin my career in data and learn new skills along the way.

Check out my [Portfolio](https://github.com/Neversole/Portfolio.git) to view my completed projects.

I am located in beautiful Beaverton, OR. In my free time, I enjoy weightlifting, hiking, fishing, and cooking.
